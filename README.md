# jwks-server
    A simple JWKS server using Python for CSCE 3550 using Flask.

# how to run on linux
    Open the terminal.
    Change the directory to the Flask project folder.
    Create/start the virtual environment.
    If needed: pip install Flask
    If needed: pip install jwcrypto
    Type "flask run" to start the server.

# notes
    - I could not get the included test suite to run on my computer,
    and there is a screenshot of what it outputs when I run it. Hopefully
    you can see what I did wrong so you can help me fix it for next time!
