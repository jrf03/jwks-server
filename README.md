# notes
    - I got the gradebot to run on my computer after submitting Part 2. There
    is a screenshot of the score it got from Part 2 as well as my score for Part 3.
    Based on what I got, it looks like I screwed it up pretty good in Part 3 and
    probably needed to work a little more carefully.
