# notes
    - Not too long after submitting Part 2, I figured out how to get gradebot running.
    I added a screenshot of the score for Part 2 that I got, as well as my score I got
    more recently for Part 3. It looks like I screwed it up pretty bad in Part 3, so
    I should have been more careful when making a bunch of changes.
